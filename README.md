"Wood Guy" - or just simply a clone of Timberman I made a while back entirely in Python Tkinter

All textures are made by me, not all of them are finished but the game is functional

A complete package with all progress and test versions of textures, crazy paint files from the concept phase AND even progress videos for those curious lol

To actually launch the game you'll need to download timberman.py, Test_Textures, logo and Textures (used textures are in 3 different folders due to the game never being fully completed)

Then to play just launch timberman.py, if you downloaded everything correctly a "Wood Guy" Tkinter window should open

Click on "Start Game" to start the game, the controls are **A** and **S**

To close the game click the "Quit Game" button or just close all windows that the game launched manually in Windows
